# ARMP - Augmented Reality Music Player #
## What is Augmented Reality? ##

**Augmented reality** (AR) is a term for a live direct or indirect view of a physical, real-world environment whose elements are _augmented_ by [computer-generated](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-generated) sensory input, such as sound or graphics. It is related to a more general concept called [mediated reality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediated_reality), in which a view of reality is modified (possibly even diminished rather than augmented) by a computer. (_source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality)_)

AR is a way to enhance one's life experience by bringing virtual elements to the real-world. The virtual world has many great things to provide us, but it's often frustrating to interact with it through poor I/O interfaces. With the massive growth of mobile devices use, the boundaries between the real and the virtual world are getting thiner, as developing AR applications in such platforms become easier.

## What is Music? ##

To many people in many cultures music is an important part of their way of life. [Greek philosophers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_philosophy) and [ancient Indian philosophers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_philosophy#Ancient_Indian_philosophers) defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as "the harmony of the spheres" and "it is music to my ears" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. (_source: [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music))_

<a href='Hidden comment: 
The way one perceives music usually depends on his culture, that"s to say on some values he shares with a group/a community. With actual social media, communities can easily be built around music, and people can get closer to their favorite artists/bands.

## What would an Augmented Reality Music Player look like? ##

That's the question we intend to answer with this project! We think that a lot of work and research has been done in the field of visual augmented reality and that investing musical augmentations could open new doors for AR applications.

AR music is music that is bound to the environment. That said, someone who uses an AR music player should be able to feel where the music is coming from and how far it is. He should also be able to identify people also using the application, and somehow living the same experience than he's living, thus creating some kind of connection in both the virtual world and the real one.

We thus decided to create such an application.

An agile method is being used for the development of this project. Even if we are a small team, it's still a good thing to keep our work organized. Start [here](http://code.google.com/p/armp/wiki/ProductBacklog) to follow the development of our application!
