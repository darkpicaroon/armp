## Achieved tasks ##

After getting the Android stock music application source code (see [US03](http://code.google.com/p/armp/wiki/Sprint1)), we created the main activity of our application, which his a map view that will display the available music spots around the user.

To do so, a new tab element has been added to the [TabWidget](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/TabWidget.html) (see [revision 47](http://code.google.com/p/armp/source/detail?r=47)), and a map view was then attached to this tab element (see [revision 54](http://code.google.com/p/armp/source/detail?r=54))

In order to display a map view in Android applications using Google Maps, one needs to register for a Maps API key in order to get access to the Maps functionalities. This can be easily achieved by following a few steps described in [this page](http://code.google.com/android/add-ons/google-apis/mapkey.html)
