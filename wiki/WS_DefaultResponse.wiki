== General structure ==
Each WS will return a XML file. That XML file can contains many elements defining the purpose of the WS.

Every WS returns the same XML structure which is the following:

{{{
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<root>
  <!-- Other elements defined by the WS -->
  <logged>xxx</logged>
  <status>xxx</status>
</root>
}}}

== The _logged_ element ==

The _logged_ element contains an integer which his value is 0 or 1:
 * *1* means _User connected_
 * *0* means _User not connected_

== The _status_ element ==

The _status_ element contrains an integer which can take several values:
 * *0* means _Nothing has been done, or, flag not modified_
 * *1* means _Operation successfully accomplished_
 * ...

A lot of values exist for that element. For each value is associated a string message that can be fetched using the [WS_GetMessage getMessage WS].
